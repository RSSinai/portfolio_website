        <h3>ABOUT ME</h3>
        <h4>A dedicated Front-end Developer based in Tel Aviv, Israel 📍</h4>
        <p className="aboutTextP">
          I'm an applied mathematics student residing in Tel-Aviv, but my heart
          belongs to Haifa, where I was raised. With 2 years in web development,
          my expertise lies in front-end development with React, driven by my
          early years in QA roles. Passionate
          about Greek 🇬🇷 Food, Music, and Philosophy, I unwind through boat
          cruising at the Sailor Jaffa club, horseback riding, and collecting
          local art.
